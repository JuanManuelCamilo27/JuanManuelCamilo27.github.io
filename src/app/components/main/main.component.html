  <h1>Welcome to My Game Development Portfolio</h1>
  <p>
    Over the past few years, I've been diving into various programming courses,
    but I recently realized I hadn't undertaken any projects on my own. That
    realization led me to seek inspiration, and I stumbled upon a YouTube video
    showcasing the development of a minesweeper game.
  </p>
  <p>
    I thought to myself, what better way to apply my newfound knowledge than by
    creating simple games? This portfolio is a collection of those projects,
    born out of a desire to learn and grow as a developer.
  </p>
  <p>
    Each game here represents a journey of planning the game mechanics and a
    user-friendly interface, coding, and problem-solving. Let me show you the
    biggest challenges I faced with each of the games:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <strong>Minesweeper: </strong> Challenges included generating mines
      randomly and managing the game's state effectively.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Memory Game: </strong> Challenges included implementing card
      matching logic and designing clear visual cues.
    </li>
    <li>
      <strong>Simon: </strong> Challenges included implementing the sequence
      generation and user input logic. Designing clear visual and auditory
      feedback was crucial for enhancing the player experience.
    </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    Feel free to explore and play the games I've created. Your feedback is
    always appreciated!
